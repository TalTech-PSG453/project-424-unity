All other features work normally: telemetry, cameras, time scale...

## How to drive the 424

Requires a steering wheel device: Logitech G27/G29, Thrustmaster, Fanatec Podium.

1. Clone the repository to your computer and open it in Unity.
2. Open one of the scenes at the Scenes folder.
3. In the Hierarchy window select the car (**PERRINN 424**), then select the **Input** GameObject in it.
4. In the **Device Input** component choose your wheel model, select the device number (normally 0), and enter the degrees of rotation currently configured in your wheel.
